story: |-
    The great scholar **Sondra Alamara** roamed the world during the **Sunset of the `3rd Age`** and was said to be the wisest being to ever exist. She figuratively conquored everything the mortal plane had to offer, and is the only person to have explored it entirely. She even fully explored the sealed continent of **Sar-Sadoth**, the fleeing lands of **Sansata**, and found the shores of the most sacred, prized locale of all; **Chiralis**, the land of origination.

    Sondra carried with her a book that would always have a new page when the previous was turned, and never increased in volume or weight regardless of content. In this tome, she took meticulous notes on every facet of the world. Sondra's writing became known as **Sondra's Scriptures**, and is considered the most complete history of all time in the known realms.

    Sondra vanished during the **Sunrise of the `4th Age`**, believed to have returned to the **Chiralis** to die at the roots of the holy tree **Audrassil**, and she took her legendary book with her. But before she left, she managed to foster several disciples who recount many of the texts they were privy to.

    It is said that a complete copy of the Scriptures may exist somewhere in the world, if someone can manage to find Chiralis. It is known that the texts number in pages over `2,147,483,648`, and that her handwriting was quite beautiful - to the point of being admired as artwork itself.

    There are temples around the world with hand-written excerpts from her scriptures that reveal the truth of the world - and it is through them that we know of the great heroes of yore.
