story: |
    Geldithyr is the oldest known great civilization of the world - and
    it is believed that the founding of its nation marks the Dawn of the
    1st Age. No one is entirely sure how old it is, or how it came to be,
    but it is inhabited mostly by the Gelvan races and is considered one
    of the most amazing sights to behold in all the world. The three major
    cultures, Gelvan, Sil’gelvan, and Mel’gelvan inhabit the continent
    in their own various cities. It should be noted though that not all
    Gelvish people are from Geldithyr, but the vast majority of them are.

    The continent itself is vibrant and lush to an extent rivalled only by
    the prehistoric climate of Riyuil. It has ageless flora and creatures
    that dazzle the imagination not found anywhere else in the world. It
    could be said that the whole land is a massive nature reserve for
    magical beasts, and as such poaching is a very large problem for them.

    Unlike most cultures, the Gelvish races prefer to gather all of
    their power into centralized locations that are grand and well
    managed. They do not waste a lot of time with auxiliary settlements
    like villages and towns. This was not an agreeable arrangement to
    the more wild Sil’gelvan and the reclusive Mel’gelvan - and so the
    culture splintered at some point. The major city of Elith’mar stands
    as what is considered the most powerful culture in the entire world.

    Originally, there were a single Gelvish race and they lived quite happily
    together. At some point in time, believed to predate even the 1st Age,
    a catastrophe separated large groups of them into different parts of the
    continent. The ecosystems in each were radically different, and as such
    each area developed separately. One faction fostered a love for magic
    and worked to bring the calamity to an end - while another withdrew from
    magical arts out of fear and respect, turning instead to the natural
    world. It is said that the other group was constantly and relentlessly
    attacked by outsiders, and developed a harsh, reclusive, war-like nature.

    The Gelvans are an elegant peoples who suffer greatly from the curse
    of longevity that has afforded them a certain arrogance over time.
    They view themselves as superior to other races in nearly every way
    - and the largest problem with this is that they are frequently
    proven correct when put to the test. They are well educated, have
    overwhelmingly versed scholars, and possess the world’s greatest known
    supply of magical talent and natural affinity for the auralforce.

    Because of their arrogance, they are generally hard to trade with. They
    impose heavy tariffs on their own goods and offer a pittance to other
    cultures for theirs. They are usually quite quick to berate others, and
    while they are considered wise and diplomatic in small numbers the culture
    as a whole is often looked upon with both awe and disdain. They just don’t
    get along well with others; That being said, they are unfathomably good at
    maintaining peace with other nations. The Gelvish people rarely go to war,
    and as such have not had many devastating battles on their homeland. This
    has allowed them to build up a supermassive society that is so well defended
    that most would find the idea of attacking it to be completely absurd.

    The people of Geldithyr are responsible for creating the artform known
    as “Enchanting”. They are one of the first civilizations to discover
    ways to imbue magical properties to objects and people without the
    use of glyphs or runes. As such, they usually look down upon ‘less
    efficient’ creations like Spellforges and Artificer’s works. Some
    works of considerably high quality are accepted at times, though.

    Geldithyr’s main deities are the same as most other cultures; Primarily
    Mordos and Ilnyvia. The wild-loving Sil’gelvan are particular to
    Magnageida though - as many nature-loving cultures tend to be. The
    Mel’gelvan usually worship Mordos or Crothiel - however all three
    cultures have respect for the entire known litany of deities.

    Geldithyr does not allow just anyone to dock at their ports, and the
    process to gain entry into the city is extensively frustrating; Wrought
    with paperwork and triplicate, as well as scrutinizing comments and
    remarks that some deride as “tests of character” - they often allow
    Gelvans to live offshore for the purpose of learning about other cultures
    and countries, and they are allowed to maintain their citizenship,
    but are never allowed to return to the city unless they are alone,
    and must physically live elsewhere. For this reason, every single home
    in Elith’mar belongs exclusively to a resident that does not leave
    its shores except for short-term expeditions and trade. Geldithyr
    “representatives” as they remark themselves are treated with respect upon
    returning home - but it is understood that they are not part of the city.

    Because of Astria’s high concentration of magic, and how close
    Geldithyr is to it, it is believed that they were the first to make
    trade agreements with the peoples of Astria during the 3rd Age.

    Highlights of Geldithyr  include;

    - ELITH’MAR
        - The jewel of the world - the capital city of the Gelvans. A massive, sprawling city of stone, orihalcum, obsidian, and silver that is stacked over 12 layers vertically with huge spires of ancient decor.
    - AFFY’XIA
        - The city of the Mel’gelvan, and while it is a heavily populated place it is widely believed that the city is a front for a passage to a more secret place.
