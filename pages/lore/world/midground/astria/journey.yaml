# Journey

Journey is the newest city in Astria, and also the smallest. The city was originally setup as a destination waypoint for travelers that wanted to adventure out into the land to the west, and would serve as a base of operations for people of all types. Journey was founded in the Dawn of the 5th Age, shortly after magic became more readily accessible to the common public.

Fortified with the ability to cast spells, a domain that had before only been touched by studios scholars who spent their entire lives in the subject, people from all over the world began to ‘journey’ to Astria to try and discover its secrets; The city was quickly created to tend to the wounded who came back empty handed, but it stands proud with the indestructible resolve of adventure, and what the land of Astria truly represents to the rest of the world.

Being a city founded by adventurers and filled with the results of their travels, its main goods are artifacts, ruins, broken spellforged equipment, fish, trinkets, and damaged items from beyond the threshold of safety.

While lacking in many of the resources that make Flamespire a hub of scholars, Journey has some of the rarest and most incredible literature ever discovered due to it having almost exclusive first-take on goods brought back from the threshold. As such, Journey has fostered an atmosphere of people who, while often lacking in book smarts, are often headstrong and confident - and usually have incredible powers to back it up.

The Haula’fin settlements around Journey are usually most interested in artificing and spellforged remains. They haven’t had a lot of good results to speak of, though …

Highlights of Journey include;

-The Journey’s End
    - a large inn that greets everyone who makes the trip to the city from the eastern cities and contains one of the few natural hot springs this far south of the mountains.
-The Jitaku Markets
    - a marketplace of goods that are largely broken and considered useless because they came from the Threshold - but appraisers often know they contain secrets. There are other vendors as well, such as food sellers and kiosks.
-The Departure Hall
    - a massive structure on the far western part of the city that overlooks the walls and is connected directly to the gates. The hall can reasonably seat about 200 people, and is renowned for having fine food accessible to those who have proven their mettle. The hall serves up meals and treats the wounded, but does not deal in exchanging money. Instead, merit is the factor that escalates one’s status in this comfortable den of retreat from weariness.
It is said that Journey is the resolve of Astria, and despite its relative lack of wealth it maintains some of the best medical practitioners in the entire land.
