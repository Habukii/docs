    Skors’sommr is a unique land in that it has powerful, recognized bodies of civilization but has made no attempt to be recognized as a world power. Many scholars suspect that Skors’sommr was once a major part of the time-lost, barrier-sealed world of Sar-Sadoth that broke off. It is the only continent that has no “discovery” date, because it is the origin of most historians besides the Gelvish ones (which are obviously better at it, of course)

    For this reason, it is believed that Skors’sommr is the first continent with a developed civilization capable of seafaring travel. The number of ruins across the land support this theory, as they tell stories of sailors returning from various lands with fascinating tales that match those lands historical records. As such, the people of Skors’sommr worship all of the known deities very diversely. They are one of few lands that openly acknowledge the existence of Worlim and Nazaire - as many stories warn to exercise caution of them.

    It is home to the oldest known tribes of Humans, as well as many different types of Ni’vana, Brahamathian, Hissith, Rockborne, Makkar, Shift, Ursaang, Abominable, and the elusive, rare, Spellforged Automaton.

    The continent itself is a beautiful, lush, and almost magical place mostly covered in snow and ice; The southern regions of the continent have a verdant feel to it though, and some places are downright rich with greenery that rivals even tropical locales.

    During the Sunset of the 1st Age, Skors’sommr began to readily dispatch sailors to the world. This led to many ships returning with knowledge of other lands, and they began to amass great stores of information and literature about them. Over time, this developed a golden age of exploration for the Skors’sommr people. These sailors were known as great explorers, and eventually formed some of the most grandiose ships ever to roam the seas. They were split into multiple factions, each represented by an animal that appeared as a marking on the people at a young age. These ships were designed to sustain entire small civilizations out at sea for up to 2 years at a time before returning home with their collected research.

    One of the major results from this process was the rapid accumulation of magical knowledge. Because of Skors’sommr’s rich culture and affinity for hard labor, they put it to use with practical application and created some of the first Spellforged creations. For that reason, it is believed some of the earliest artificers hailed from this land.

    Over time - approximately during the Dusk of the 3rd Age, most of the Spellforged creations were destroyed or abandoned as a strange plague swept the land that robbed people of their magical affinity. During this period the people began to focus even more heavily on sea exploration and physical maturity. The people of Skors’sommr became extremely tough and hardened, especially with their harsh, freezing climates. The civilization that had created so many spellforged artifacts was all but lost to time, and would remain that way until the magical awakening of the 5th Age.

    It is believed that at some point during the Sunset of the 1st Age, the Goddess Magnageida visited certain tribes of people and bestowed upon them the power to embody powerful beasts. The Shift rose from this event, and took it upon themselves to cultivate productive relationships with the existing Ni’vana and Brahamathian that already lived on Skors’sommr.

    It is believed that the humans had remarkably close relationship with the Hissith and Makkar during this same period - which is understood to be a factor in how they so quickly developed grand Spellforged creations. While it is known that the Rockborne inhabit the continent, they are very rarely seen. Ancient fairy-tales in Skors’sommr attribute this to the theory that the Rockbourne are guardians of the world created by the goddess Ilnyvia - this is further emphasized by the way they worshiped the stone-golems created with magic that would be called Spellforged Automatons, and built them as protectors of the villages.

    Skors’sommr is believed to have mastered the craft of leatherworking and blacksmithing, and is attributed with the earliest non-Gelvan sea-worthy vessels. At one point in time, a large party from Skors’sommr tried to raid Astria - this is largely attributed to the disease that had robbed them of much of their magic, and the rumors that Astria was rich with it. It took from the Dawn of the 4th Age to the Dusk of the 4th Age for these tensions to mend and trade to truly open up with them.

    It's also known that the mysterious sage, **Sondra**, visited Skors'sommr during the `3rd` and `4th` Age.
