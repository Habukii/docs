    Nahauzca is a lush, vibrant green land south of Astria that is home
    to a large population of Sprites, Greenskin, Gobu’rhin, Haula’fin,
    Ni’vana, Brahamathian, Shift, Gnasha, Rajira, Earthbound, and
    Hissith. Nahauzca has the largest number of beast-like races per
    square-meter of all the lands in the world by a factor of 60. There
    are Humans on the continent, but they are largely rare and hidden
    away in the southern area of the continent, beneath the Birthmark.

    The Birthmark is a massive crag - a scar across the entire continent, that
    runs from shore to shore horizontally almost directly in the center of the
    land. It is called such because legend suggests that it was first created
    when the world was born and new; However time has caused all sorts of
    problems with the Birthmark, and it is known that any creature or person
    who dies within it will wander aimlessly as a ghost forever - their spirit
    will never leave this realm, and they can only partially interact with
    the world around them. What is worse, there is no evidence that suggests
    they can be returned to their previous form, or freed from this fate.

    The land itself is overgrown with more foliage than most of the known world
    combined; And beyond that, most of the plant-life in Nahauzca is dozens
    of times larger and stronger than anywhere else. It is not uncommon for
    trees to stretch over 1km into the sky, or canopies of leaves so large
    and thick that entire villages can use them as shields from large storms.

    Above the birthmark are the beast races, which encountered others of
    their kind in the Dawn of the 3rd Age, and joined the Darukai tribe
    along with those races on Astria. Below the birthmark, humans live a very
    tribal lifestyle worshiping Ilnyvia, Aquapheas, Magnageida, and Neldraug.

    Despite the difference in the races, they are extremely peaceful here;
    The Ni’vana and Sprites have a long history with almost all of the
    inhabitants and act as intermediaries, healers, and messengers. They
    are protected ritually by the Brahamathian and Hissith, who do not allow
    anyone to injure the caregivers of their land. The humans, as well,
    respect these traditions and Nahauzca is one of the only continents
    where beast tribes and humans very actively trade with each other. For
    this reason, Nahauzca is one of the most valued providers of artifacts
    from these races, and one of the only ones where explicit permission
    to trade in them has been given to humans by the tribes themselves.

    There is an intensely hateful faction of Hissith and Greenskin that
    have, over time, created a new hybrid race known only as the Longjaw - a
    crocodile-type species that specializes in magic while still exercising a
    war-like physique. The Longjaw frequently make chaos for all of the races
    on the land, but in particular they slaughter humans and Ni’vana the most.
    It is said that the Gobu’rhin and Gnasha are responsible for the acts of
    war against other tribes that led to the Hissith and Greenskin creating
    the Longjaw - but this has never been confirmed. There is also a strange
    tribe of Gobu’rhin and Haula’fin species that is starting to emerge,
    featuring peculiar traits not unlike the Gelvan’s own affinity for magic.

    Another notable landmark of Nahauzca is the Mystic Volcano - a massive,
    skyscraping volcano that is hollow inside and spews lightning perpetually.

    There is a Sil’gelvan settlement within the forests of Nahauzca, but
    it is well hidden - only the Sprites know its location and they seem
    unwilling to divulge that fact. It is believed that the Sil’gelvan are
    silent watchers and researchers, and have traded something with the
    Sprites in exchange for their silence. Very few have ever seen them.

    At the Sunset of the 3rd Age, Nahauzca had two individual trading
    agreements formed with Astria and other nations - one from the
    Darukai, and one from the civilizations beneath the Birthmark.

    Beneath the Birthmark are several temples to unknown deities -
    many of them representing a strange creature embraced in lightning.
    Most of these temples are actually built on the underside of
    cliffs and canyons, similar to ancient shrines found in Honoshia.
    It is suspected that people fleeing Honoshia during the 2nd Age
    may have migrated here - but that has never been confirmed.
