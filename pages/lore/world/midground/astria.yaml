    Astria is a continent in the northwestern part of the world that
    is vibrantly rich in mana - sometimes called aura, or auralforce
    directly. It is not entirely clear when the continent was settled,
    but as early as the Dusk of the 3nd Age it has been home to vibrant
    populous of Human, Haula’fin, Gelvan, Greenskin, Makkar, Undine,
    and there is even a Ni’vana settlement somewhere on the land.

    The area to the west of Journey is known as the “Threshold” - a metered,
    measured zone where the threat-level of the land increases by a factor
    of hundreds. It is said that Journey is on the absolute edge of this
    threshold and that the city was built there to account for that. The
    area containing the Threshold is known collectively as the “Westlands”.

    At the center of the Threshold is a rising spire of land known
    as the Grave Plateau. The closer one gets to this rising crop of
    land, the more dangerous the land becomes. To date, very little
    is known about the plateau except that it stinks of death and
    over 99% of people who have gone to it have never been heard from
    again. The walls seem impossible to climb, and attempting to access
    it from the sky seems to show a land shrouded in choking fog.

    It is rumored that some of the chimeric beasts that
    roam the land have stepped foot on the plateau. But
    they’re not very friendly, so it’s never been confirmed.

    Up until the 5th Age, magic was very restrictive and harder to come by
    across the world. For some reason, during the dawn of the 5th age, more
    and more people began to awaken magical abilities across the world.
    This has led to a resurgence in trying to explore Astria’s secrets.
