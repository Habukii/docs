story: |
    Mordos was the first, original god of all the realms - from the first iteration of time and is the primary entity that persists between each cycle of the universe. It is not entirely known how he came to be such, or if he is responsible for the cycle itself, or even if he is the one who created the universe or was created within it. What is known is that his power, wisdom, and mantle is undisputed even among the gods - including the dark gods.

    At some point, it is known that Mordos determined there was a need for other ruling deities to govern the realms with him. Whether this was due to a sense of loneliness, wise observation, or even sheer boredom is a question that has never been answered. From his desire to create a sense of balance, his personality was intentionally fractured to create the dark god Naldraug. Naldraug and Mordos share the same body and soul - and may never exist simultaneously.

    The specific side of Mordos that is evoked is determined by the mood of his attendant, Ilnyvia. A goddess created purely out of Mordos’ wisdom, when Ilnyvia is positioned on his right hand, Mordos’ personality and heart shines through. When she stands upon his left, Naldraug is present. In this manner, the two deities form a trinity of sorts that has persisted across all the iterations of time thus far.

    In the first iteration of time, Mordos created powerful creatures known as dragons - the most supreme of them being the great Varsogg. The purpose of dragons was to act as stewards of the gift of magic and the elements, and to cultivate the civilizations by holding knowledge and determining the rate at which it should be distributed. For reasons unknown, Varsogg eventually defied this charge and went berserk - he caused a terrible rampage that wreaked havoc on all the lands.

    It is unclear why Mordos did not - or could not - destroy Varsogg. Before the Dawn of the 1st Age, Mordos and Ilnyvia descended to the realm to intervene in the destruction being wrought. They gifted earrings to rising warriors, Hollister and Aramil, who had begun to forge the Dawnbreakers. These two great men sealed Varsogg away so that a way to defeat him could be discerned. Eventually, Varsogg would be released from his prison and slain by the peoples of the world, who would unite against him.

    Eventually, an entity left-over from the previous cycle managed to drift aimlessly through the ages. Her name lost even to the gods, she observed this cycle and story several times over with regret and remorse. Her feelings for the pain and agony brought by the dragon kept building each time, and during one iteration of time her emotions wrested a change in Aramil’s heart. Time did not unfold as expected, and the powerful mage went berserk with the power given to him by Naldraug. This in turn created the horrible fracture that would forever change the course of events on this world, and Aramil ascended to become the dark god Worlim.

    Mordos intervened at this moment, and trapped the realm in a sort of stasis - lest it be obliterated entirely. This caused time to slow to a crawl within it, and while the rest of the universe continued to move forward and reset, the process would forever be different on this small world. The elemental planes also tried to intervene to help, which led to the destruction of their own world.

    It is not clear why Mordos lacks the power to fix this problem - only a select few even know the cycle exists, and it is considered taboo among his followers to disclose the truth. This taboo was not decreed by the god himself, however.

    Mordos’ primary doctrine is one of minimal intervention, but observation and preservation. He is relatively neutral - however will typically side with the light, since his alter-ego sides with the darkness. Being the progenitor of all things, Mordos is frequently attributed as the patron of the Auralforce and Arcanum.
