# Blue Mesa

The Blue Mesa’s foundation is unknown, and there is no available record of it. It is believed that the city originated sometime at the Dusk of the 2nd Age, but it was not discovered by Astrians until well after Flamespire was founded.

As the story goes, a party of adventurers discovered some manner of passage into a realm of elemental beings known as the Undine, where they were trapped in a plane entirely of water. They helped these peoples escape from that locale, and the blue mesa came into being. The Undine occupied an area that appeared to already be setup like a city - sparking speculation that they had come from that place originally. Neither the Undine themselves nor any record discovered has been able to confirm this.

Because of the obvious difficulty with surviving in the Blue Mesa, it is not a common attraction for citizens. Nevertheless, people do live there and it has a thriving community. The Blue Mesa deals in fine jewelry and remarkable enchantments, and they are host to the most fascinating songs ever recorded in the entire realm.

Attempts at forming Haula’fin settlements in the Blue Mesa usually meet with drowning - but a few exist … they’re just not often heard from again.
