    From the beginning of time, **dragons** were the prominent power in the cosmos and specifically the **Midground**. The horrible **Varsogg** terrorized the world with a plague of despair, and unleashed the **Forgotten** on the realm.

    Eventually, the races would band together to stand against this threat. That moment in time became known as the rise of the mortal world, and is the beginning of tracking history by **Ages**. The battle with Varsogg is called the **Dawn of the `1st Age`**, and during that time, the **Threshold** was created in **Astria**. The first age immediately follows a period of time known as the **Daybreak** - the series of events and encounters that set the field for the final confrontation with the **Vorpal Dragon** himself.
