    The Northplains is a continent in the upper northwestern part of
    the world, directly northwest of Astria that is primarily populated
    by Humans, though ancient parts of the plains are known to be home
    to many Rockborne, Makkar, Brahamathian, Greenskin, Gobu’rhin, and
    Ni’vana. It is also believed that some of the first Lifedrinkers
    originated from Northplains, but that has never been fully confirmed.

    The Northplains rose up with major civilizations during the Sunset of
    the 1st Age and are considered an exceptional world power. It is believed
    that they were established due to a convenient situation where the peoples
    there obtained exceptionally useful information from the Gelvans of
    Geldithyr that advanced their civilization in remarkable ways. The culture
    is surprisingly lacking in magical ability, as is seen by the fact that
    their representation of warriors is generally more brute-strength and
    strategy oriented. For reasons unknown, the Northplains and Geldithyr
    competed in a great trial against each other at some point in time - much
    to everyone’s surprise, the Northplains emerged victorious. It is believed
    that the prize was a scroll of ancient knowledge, and this accelerated
    the human’s society many ages beyond what it should naturally be.

    The people of this land are primarily followers of the deities
    Mordos and Ilnyvia, but there is a heavy sect of the population
    that is very devoted to Crothiel. Additionally, the various beast
    and chimeric races that dot the landscape - especially its ruins
    - are known to have great loyalty to Magnageida and Aquapheas.

    There is mythos that a legendary warrior, known only as
    Hollister, was originally born in the Northplains. However,
    records of his life exist in Skors’sommr as well. It is still
    unclear where he hails from. The Northplains makes sure to
    point out that he is well known in their history, though.

    The humans of the Northplains have a long history of tinkering with
    artificing - but the culture’s inherent ineptitude for magic has made
    that a difficult task. They systematically lack the experience to
    infuse mana and aether into glyphs at very complicated levels - which
    is completely opposite their related brethren in Skors’sommr. Because
    of this, artificing in the Northplains has focused more on gears,
    cogs, springs, and finding ways to motivate ambulation or simple tasks
    with intricate movement and gyroscopic methodology opposed to magic.

    This also led to the rise of the “Gunslingers” - and although they are
    rare, they are fairly exclusive to the Northplains. The only other known
    lands to have developed any clear firearms are the Privateers of Corsario,
    and it is well known fact that it is all repurposed from the Northplains.

    The result has yielded some fascinating “Clockwork” technology that
    is said to be some of the most intricate in the world - but actual
    automatons of any intelligence or sentience have rarely been born
    from the Northplains. Each of their devices does one thing very well,
    and is usually quite flashy - but they are all hand operated simple
    machines. Nevertheless, the artificing practices are considered
    astounding and earned them universal respect from their peers.

    The Northplains exists in a very harsh biome where the temperature
    changes very radically across all the seasons. It is usually
    extremely hot and dry - or very cold and dry. They have very poor
    rainfall year round and as such have adapted to this lifestyle.

    Inversely, the beast tribes of the land are remarkably powerful and
    intelligent. They live within the multiple ancient ruins of an unknown
    civilization, which are all marked heavily by Makkar influence,
    and are intensely well versed in magical arts that are generally
    considered lost to the world otherwise. It is not completely clear
    why the beast factions live at peace with humans, but it seems
    the Ni’vana of the Northplains act as peacekeepers between them.

    Highlights of the Northplains include;

    - DARIUS
        - The main city of the city-state nation, located in the center of the continent.
    - DAWNRAKE, LARK, GRASSHAWK
        - Supplemental cities surrounding Darius on the North, East, and West respectively.
