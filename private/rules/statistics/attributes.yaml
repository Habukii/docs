# Attributes

Attributes are core aspects that all characters have, and they describe varying concepts related to a character's condition and measures of generic health, mentality, and ability.

[!blue] > Attributes exist on your sheet, but can also be rolled as challenges against in-game situations as a _modifier_ to a `1d20`.
