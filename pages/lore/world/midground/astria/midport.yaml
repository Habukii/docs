    Midport was built during the Rise of the 3rd Age as adventurers began to become aware of Astria and start traveling to it. The land had a rampant problem with people just docking ships in whatever way they wished, and damaging the landscape - as well as bandits attacking anyone who tried to sail close to the shore. Midport was created in response to this - as well as offers from Geldithyr, and Honoshia to open trade with Astria. The Northplains quickly joined this proverbial cavalcade of trade agreements and Astria was officially introduced to the known world.

    Its strategic position, and close relationship to the tightly closed off land of Geldithyr made Astria an ideal place for many nations to desire friendly relations - or hostile ones. Midport was built closer inland so that ships docking had to pass over the Blue Mesa, where the Undine aided the people in protecting the city from threats coming by sea.

    Because of its quick accessibility to the sea, Midport is the most heavily populated city with extreme racial diversity. While the entire land of Astria is very diversified, it is nothing like in Midport. The people here also excel greatly at diplomacy, as many ambassadors live in - or arrive to - Midport. It is the departure point for any meetings with the councils, and it is the arrival point of most modern trade. Despite the diplomacy though, Midport is very well known for having understandably rowdy - excited citizens who will celebrate at a moment’s notice.

    Midport shares a channel that runs from the Blue Mesa up to Cromwell, and as such has direct water access to the other cities. This is considered the safest way to transport goods, as traveling by foot opens parties up to more risks - but it has also caused the channel to be very expensive to book passage through.

    The Haula’fin settlements around Midport are the most traditional, and specialize in food, fabrics, and “fabrics”.
