    Nazaire is a name given to the present incarnation of malice and spite that roams the world in its most powerful form; An all consuming collective of emptiness and hate that falls into such dark despair that it approaches a level of power rivaling the gods.

    The first Nazaire was a man named `Aramil El'tanrian` - a close disciple and personal friend of the righteous man known only to history as `Hollister`. Upon his sudden descent into madness, Aramil had already received inconceivable powers from the dark god `Naldraug`, and as such he immediately ascended to this state, taking on a form similar to a `Lich` before evolving further into the new `Dark God Worlim`.

    As such, each incarnation of Nazaire nears closer and closer to actually becoming Worlim - as the darkness in one's heart keeps swallowing their soul, they oft seek out power and chaos. The more of this they are exposed to, the more corroded their essence becomes until at last the being is indistinguishable from Worlim.

    At this time, Worlim and Naizaire briefly become the same person, increasing Worlim's dark powers several hundred fold in the process. This purges the world in a dreadful **howl** that vacates the bodies of those who hear of their very souls and memories, leaving them as dry husks that wander lifelessly.

    There is only ever one Naizaire forming at any moment in time, and every age has had at least 2 incarnations of him recorded. It is not known where the present Naizaire is being created, but most scholars speculate that they are responsible for the terrible curse in the **Birthmark** on **Nahauzca**.
