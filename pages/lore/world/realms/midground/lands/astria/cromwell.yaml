story: |
    Cromwell is a mountain-based city built in the Dusk of the 3rd Age, not too long after Flamespire. It was constructed to present the military force the land had built up; The mountainous locale was an obvious choice. It is the 3rd city to be built in the land, and was created defensively as a response to threats from the north.

    After Astria came into light of the world, and more people began to flock to it, so too did threats to overthrow the land and try to lay claim to its vast secrets. It was not uncommon for parties of strong adventurers wielding magical tools and weapons to try and sweep in from the north to take Flamespire by surprise. Midport was usually kept safe because of its relationship with the Blue Mesa, and while Flamespire was easily defended, the people began to fear that the prolific growth of magical artifacts in the world would begin to make the odds unbalanced.

    Cromwell was built by the best crafters in the land - and as such became a fascinating city of artisans. They specialize heavily in metal, stonework, crafters, and surprisingly fine artwork. Cromwell is the only city in Astria with a notably large Makkar population - many of which were actually native to the region, but had little interaction with the outside world until this time.

    Besides foreign threats, the various chimeric, Greenskin, and beast tribes that dot the area beyond the northern mountains are a constant threat to Cromwell - attempts at treaties with them have proven useless due to both language and cultural barriers, but the most notable argument is that approaching the Manashore lake from the east is the safest route, and Cromwell controls that passage. While the beasts have a war-like nature and are not averse to combat, they tend to frown on taking risks to their families for the sake of just getting basic needs met. In response to this, the allied tribes make retreat and safety in the mountains difficult for adventurers and citizens.

    The Haula’fin settlements around Cromwell are very rugged and durable - usually master artisans and stonecutters. They are extremely rough and are sometimes mistaken for Makkar. Especially the women.
    Highlights of Cromwell include;

    - Stoneport
        - While the name is boring, it is a marvelous port where goods and crafted items are shipped to Journey, Flamespire, and Midport through the nearby channel. It is considered the central trading hub for anyone wanting to find a crafter in Astria.
    - The Lone Nord
        - A supermassive inn and tavern that is built by an adventurer, for adventurers. It is the largest in the entire land of Astria.
    - The Iron Sprocket
        - A very artisan themed inn and tavern that caters to the grungy folk who do the dirty work in the mountains and on the anvils.
    - The Raven’s Nest
        - A very casual, laid back inn and tavern for the common traveler.
    - The Anvil
        - A very large, very rugged combat arena for friendly competition and large gladiatorial events.

    It can be said that Cromwell is the might of Astria - and it is the city most prepared for both defense and assault without magic.
