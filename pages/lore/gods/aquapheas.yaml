    Aquapheas actually started life as a very lowly water elemental named Wi’nah. Early in the creation of the universe there was no spoken word among the elementals - the powers cultivated by the dragons and given life through their various flames. The water elementals banded together and introduced the blessing of song into the realms, and this trait began to spread across the various planes and realms.

    Wi’nah was the first to divide properties of the elements into distinct categories - creating Water and Ice, and in doing so birthed the first of the aspects. As her song spread to the other realms, the aspects of the Land and Sky would form as well. Inevitably, Mordos would use these ideas to shape worlds with many fascinating beings and creatures.

    Eventually, Mordos’ alter-ego, Naldraug, came to the elementals and spoke out - issuing the first commands to them and introducing language. The song-like elementals quickly adapted to this concept and began to communicate with one another in fascinating new ways. In return though, he demanded their power of song to create and control elements - and he did so with contemptible actions.

    Refusing to yield their power to Naldraug, the elemental realms were fractured into pieces along the plane of water. The water elementals sealed off in a separate space to act as a prison - while they could only stare down and watch the other gods create wonderful, amazing life as time passed them by.

    Wi’nah watched this with sadness in her heart, and eventually she began to emulate the amazing lives she saw created through the water - she and the other water elementals taking on shapes similar to that of both women and the beautiful fish she spent countless iterations of time watching with envy at their freedom to swim the worlds. This would create the race known as the Undine - and Wi’nah’s perseverance would be rewarded as she ascended to become the princess of the Undine, and after birthing a daughter who took that role, she became the goddess Aquapheas and was given governance over the seas and waters of the realm.

    It is said that the original songs of the elementals are stored in various music boxes scattered across the realm.
