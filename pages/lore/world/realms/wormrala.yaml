    The historical accounts of "Worm-ra-la" date back to pretty much no-when and seem to follow the tale of promised return by the **Lord of Caterpillars**, who will appear among us with great light and lead his marked, chosen few away to this magical realm.

    The accounts of Worm-ra-la are all written in crayon, so scholars assume that perhaps the Lord of Caterpillars only visits children through some means, or that there is something very bad in the water.

    > The land of Worm-ra-la will be filled with bountiful naked boobies, and it will flow with rivers of booze and cheese and there will always be sunshine and it'll be bright and sunny and some of the girls will have three breasts.

    Suffice it to say, it's believed the mythos of Worm-ra-la is the result of some poor hallucinaginic reaction; But the parents of the 'scholars' who write these accounts assure us that it's **super** serious.
    
    The only thing we know for sure is that the **Great Super Lord God of Caterpillars** will be green and black, and that he will appear in the `5th Age`. We also know that children should not drink from the streams coming from the western-most part of the Cromwell mountains.
