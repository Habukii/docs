    The world is filled with various effects, powers, and properties known as **aspects**. These are also referred to as **forces** by some cultures, and cover the entire gamut of concepts from magic to spirituality.

    The aspects may be thought of like a plate - from the outside, the **Auralforce** encompasses all of nature and the organic elements, including the innate forces of **Mysticism** and **Mindforce** that flow through living things.

    Further in, nature itself is divided into `3` categories; `Land, Sea,` and `Sky`. These contain the elements `Earth, Fire, Water, Ice, Wind,` and `Lightning` respectively.

    From the interior of the plate, `Arcanum` pours outwards - **also** capable of creating all of these same forces; This is why they are between **Auralforce** and **Arcanum**.

    Deeper inward is the realm of `Divinity` - which cannot be created by magic or nature alone. This is the domain of `Dawn` and `Dusk`, power sourced directly from the gods and the underworlds themselves.
