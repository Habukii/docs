story: |
    Recorded time before the 4th Age is commonly referred to as "Antiquity" - and while the term may apply to any point in the lost history, it most frequently earmarks events that occurred during the 2nd and 3rd Ages, when arcanum was at its absolute peak and the civilizations flourished.

    During the 2nd Age, the nomads of Skors'sommr began to research ways to build their own autonomous servants. Though the earliest attempts at Spellforged Automatons were in the 2nd Age, it was not until the 3rd Age that beings of any truly remarkable design began to surface.

    The 2nd Generation of Spellforges, especially, fascinated the world so much that other cultures began to capture and dissect them, in turn learning many secrets of the art of Glyphology, which would later become known as Runescription.

    A fierce martial artist, at one time even a wielder of one of the legendary Zanmaedao, known as Adol was especially renown for his interest in these autonomous slaves. He grew so enamored with them that he sought to become a golem in his own right. Adol abandoned his life of combat and poured his soul into scientific study, Runescription, Auramancy, and even forbidden lore of the Forgotten.

    Adol discovered that while turning his body into an actual golem was possible, he would not live long enough to perfect the technique. To that end, he engineered a way to prolong his life and attain immeasurable power at the cost of unparalleled pain and suffering. He began by fashioning thin needles, similar to those used in acupuncture, and tipping them with pure aetheric energy drawn from a ritual site where mana was so rich that it bubbled to the surface like water.

    As mortality threatened to claim him, Adol dug dozens of these aetheric needles into his veins - pushing them so deep that eventually the tips would snap off, and leave permanent metal fragments fused with arcane in his blood. This prolonged his life unnaturally, but the immeasurable pain proved to deter scientific factions from funding or adopting his research.

    For 300 years, Adol tempered his technique and continued to toil away - stricken with disease and poverty, he seemed almost immortal to onlookers, but even with his mana-fused blood, he knew that his days were running low. At last, Adol encountered a peculiar man named Mladris Arave while spending his remaining days as a beggar in the rough ports of Corsario. Mladris was a bit of a savant, even at a young age, and had begun researching other ways to extend life with more natural techniques, and gentler forms of magic.

    Through his studies, Mladris aided Adol in refining his ideas. Through an amazing art that was being called "Necromancy", Adol discovered that the body itself could be revitalized with this mystic force that flowed through his own veins. The art of necromancy would begin to gain traction as a panacea for the sick and wounded, but eventually Mladris' loss of a loved one led him to dive into a darker side of his research, and the two had a falling out.

    Adol, now aged 507, finished fashioning a special type of ink that quickly penetrated the skin. He painted his entire body with this glossy blue paint, and soon enough his very blood began to boil with the same beautiful ghost-blue he had seen in those amazing Spellforged Automatons.

    The paint would eventually turn his veins into conduits of energy; His very biology became an amazing network of ley-lines that not only restored his youth, but he discovered he could actually pull his blood veins from his own body to utilize their energy in new, interesting ways. Adol became famous for his amazing ability to actually tear his veins out, in front of others, like a marionette's strings. He began to design new styles of combat and medicine based on this discovery, but was especially famous for his ability to put his blood into others, and tear out fatal injuries such as tumors, parasites, and cancers.

    At the age of 992, Adol began to realize that his life was tethered to the supply of mana where he first began; His veins had become such pure with energy that he could no longer survive too far from the rift in Skors'sommr. Having developed a fascination for the world, and a desire to discover all it had to offer, he was overwhelmed with sadness at the irony of his own design.

    To that end, Adol became known as a Guru, locally. People would come to him for healing, but he became more reclusive as his fervor for a certain 'pet project' grew. His adoration for the beautiful Spellforges had him researching how to perhaps create something to carry on his work ... but we may never know if he succeeded.

    During the 4th Age, when the 4th Generation of Spellforged Automatons wreaked havoc across Skors'sommr as the power of magic began to diminish from the world, a box was discovered with Adol's aetheric paint. There's enough left for one person.
