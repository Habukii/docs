    Before mankind confronted the terrible beast **Varsogg** and his allied, deific **Forgotten**, there were marked periods of time when the sun and stars were blocked out for days at a time. During these points, Varsogg, the **Vorpal Dragon** would become larger than ever and all but consume the planet with his massive wings; Plunging the entirety of it into pure darkness.

    The people felt that this was a sign that the gods had turned their back on their creation, and refer to the spans of time between each of these events as **Abandonments** in the same way they would later come to remark **Ages** after the great battle with the beast.
