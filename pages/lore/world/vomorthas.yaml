    It is believed that Vomorthas is the name of the realm where the **Forgotten** came from. Though its origins are especially vague, the fables over time posit that the **Vorpal Dragon**, **Varsogg**, discovered the existence of Vomorthas when he went completely mad with power and tried to chew through the roots of the holy tree **Audrassil** in **Chiralis**.

    After becoming aware of this realm, Varsogg allegedly tore stars from the sky and dropped them to the Midground, where they hatched to reveal prisoners banished to our realm from Vomorthas, and forgotten by their world.

    The scribe **Sondra** notes in the testament of her travels that Vomorthas is not an evil realm, but it is too different from our own to possibly grasp with limited mortal comprehension. Like a world made of fluid and vapor instead of tangible stone and earth, the very properties of existance are entirely unlike what we would consider _real_, and therefore it is believed that mortals can only comprehend Vomorthas in their dreams.
