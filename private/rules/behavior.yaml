# Code of Conduct
The Auraverse code of conduct is relatively simple and straightforward;

 - Respect the other players and staff.
 - Avoid meta-gaming whenever possible.
 - Respect the rules, and the decisions of the staff.
 - Keep "adult" roleplay in private.
 - Keep content in the respective game where it occurs.
 - Avoid copyrighted content.
 - Do not poach for or from the game.

We do not feel these are difficult to do. If you feel you cannot abide by these standards, then the Auraverse may not be a good fit for you.

# Code of Content
The rules for roleplay are relatively loose and simple, we have only a few requests of players.

 - Respect in-game acquired items in flavor, lore, etc.
   - Players work hard to earn items; Just because you have 'creative freedom' doesn't give you the right to rip off their flavor.
 - Respect in-game boundaries.
   - Flight, teleportation, transformation, telepathy, and in particular dragons are special content that is reserved for the game's rules and lore to assign, access, and exist. Please respect the boundaries of the world we have placed, and we can make content more fun for everyone.


# Above all else...
## The *Auraverse* is a **game**.
