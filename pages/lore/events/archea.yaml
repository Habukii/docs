    Archea is the period of time before the `1st Age` in its entirety, and extends all the way to the creation of the universe. Archea is considered a part of **Antiquity**, but often spoken of when referring to darker periods of time known as the **Abandonments**; Long stretches where it seemed the gods had turned their back on the world and left it to ruination.
