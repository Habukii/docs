    The dark god Worlim was once a man named `Aramil El'tanrian`, a member of the `Dawnbreakers` and best friend of the singularly-named `Hollister`. Aramil's lifespan was unnaturally long, and his actual race never properly recorded to time - but it is known that he most closely resembled a human, despite possessing a Gelvish name.

    It is said that Aramil lived to the age of `6,300` through some unclear means, and in doing so became a wise scholar that eschewed the ways of battle and took up romance, art, and literature. In many ways, Aramil's philanthropic deeds far outpaced his more historically remarked comrade, but were overshadowed by the later deeds of his life.

    The accounts of Aramil's actual deeds are mostly lost to time, since he lived well before the `Dawn of the 1st Age` - indeed it was his descent into madness that would actually usher the world into its first recorded age, wiping out the history before it in a terrible calamity.

    The reasons for his longevity are not known, but ancient accounts of Aramil assert that he used a walking staff carved from a `magic tree` that was obtained in `Skors'sommr` at some point. While many have tried to find this special flora, none have yielded success. Nevertheless, the incredible power exuding from his staff is usually attributed to his incredible prowess and lifespan.

    Hollister and Aramil's numerous achievements in life, and the sorrows they bore together as they lost so many beloved to them in the wake of disaster by the dragon `Varsogg` led the gods to specifically seek them out for the task of sealing the beast. `Mordos` bestowed the power of `Dawn` upon Hollister, and `Naldraug` the power of `Dusk` to Aramil, and they succeeded in placing the dragon within a prison in the Undercore.

    However, tasting the true power of the gods, Aramil's understanding and wisdom exploded a million-fold. He had already reached a level of such unparalleled enlightenment that the presence of these entities allowed him to see into an abyss that no mortal should perceive. He quickly went mad as a result, and became the Dark God Worlim.

    The magnitude of sorrow that this catastrophe released upon the world created the cycle of `Nazaire`, and Worlim's power grows as his sorrow continues to infect others throughout the flow of time.
