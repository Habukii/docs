    Ilnyvia is a goddess created by Mordos using his own wisdom to help balance good and evil - including his own. She persists across each iteration of time and takes a much more hands-on approach to the universe, getting involved with people on a massive scale to help ensure that the world continues on. She has a strong sense of morality and justice, but does not make actions on behalf of ‘good’ or ‘evil’.

    Her primary concern with the world is to fulfill whatever Mordos’ vision is for any one period. Sometimes this means aiding an entire world to rise up in power, and sometimes it means stepping back and allowing it to be torn down.

    As the holder of Mordos’ consciousness, she decides whether the deity is manifest as Mordos or his darkness, Naldraug. When Ilnyvia is on his right side, his light shines through - and when she is on his left, the dark god is manifest. It is known that Mordos can freely turn around to change this however, so he is clearly not beholden to Ilnyvia’s whims - this suggests there is a strong bond of trust between the two.

    She is typically pictured as a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair of either white or black - and a blindfold of the opposite color depending on the context of the information. She is usually the deity that cultures worship early on because of her direct interaction with the world in recorded lore.

    It is known that before the Dawn of the 1st Age, she touched the world at two separate points - standing on a different side of Mordos at both. These points would become the Dawn Crease and the Dusk Crease in the land of Astria, and many legends attribute them to a great deal of the magical power that overflows from that land. It is not completely clear if this is true, but it is well known that intense power resonates from each site and they are considered extremely important religious locales.

    It is known that Ilnyvia is the goddess responsible for returning souls to their body when implored by menders of sufficient magical power. Her doctrine is very often one of direct intervention for the preservation of life and culture. It is also known that she is considered an extremely compassionate goddess, and will gladly offer up her powers to those who use it selflessly - for this reason, she is very much attributed to be the matron of Dawn magic.
