# Talents

## Excellence in a narrow topic.

Talents are similar to masteries, except that they are more narrow and specific - usually affecting only one very small aspect of a character. Talents are the primary way to customize your character outside of equipment.

[!green] > You select `1` talent at `Level 1`, and an additional talent every `10 Levels` after, up to `Level 90`, for a total of `10`.

### Epic Talents

After reaching `Level 100`, you unlock the ability to begin selecting **Epic Talents**. These are weighted much differently, and usually have higher quality than normal talents.

[!green] > You select `1` epic talent at `Level 100`, and every `10 Levels` afterwards, up to `Level 140`, for a total of `5` epic talents.

### Grand Talents

**Grand Talents** are the most heavily weighted, and incredibly powerful of all.

[!green] > At `Level 150`, you unlock the final talent slot - a classification known as a **Grand Talent**.
